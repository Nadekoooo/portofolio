        "## 1. Introductions\n\nWelcome to this notebook, created for the the project project. In this project, we are tasked with analyzing and predicting mental health conditions based on responses to a series of questions. The dataset includes various indicators of mental well-being and aims to identify specific mental health conditions.\n\nThe columns in our dataset are:\n\n- **User_ID**: Unique identifier for each respondent.\n- **How have you been feeling lately?**\n- **Have you been sleeping well?**\n- **Do you find it hard to concentrate?**\n- **Have you lost interest in activities you used to enjoy?**\n- **Do you feel tired or fatigued most of the time?**\n- **Do you feel nervous, anxious, or on edge frequently?**\n- **Have you experienced sudden panic attacks?**\n- **Do you avoid social situations or activities you used to enjoy?**\n- **Have you experienced flashbacks or nightmares about a traumatic event?**\n- **Do you feel detached from reality or your surroundings?**\n- **Mental Health Condition**: The diagnosed mental health condition.\n- **Have you experienced sudden panic attacks? Do you avoid social situations or activities**: (Note: This column appears to be a concatenation error and contains no valid data).\n\n### Objectives\n\nThe primary objectives of this notebook are:\n1. To explore the data, understand its structure, and clean it as necessary.\n2. To analyze the distribution of responses for each question.\n3. To correlate the responses with the diagnosed mental health conditions.\n4. To draw insights and conclusions that can help in predicting mental health conditions based on the given responses.\n\n### Analysis Approach\n\n1. **Data Cleaning**: We will remove the column with the concatenation error and handle any missing values appropriately.\n2. **Data Exploration**: We will perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of responses and identify any patterns.\n3. **Data Visualization**: Visual tools will be used to illustrate the relationships between responses and mental health conditions.\n4. **Conclusion Drawing**: Based on the analysis, we will draw conclusions about common symptoms associated with each mental health condition and how different questions correlate with these conditions.\n\nBy the end of this notebook, we aim to have a comprehensive understanding of the data and clear insights that can be used for predictive modeling in the context of mental health.\n\n---\nThe next section explains the dataset and problem context used in this personal project.\n"

This decision is made because:\n     - The dataset contains only a small number of missing values.\n     - Random imputation could introduce biases, especially in medical and psychological data where accuracy is crucial.\n     - Ensuring the integrity of the data is paramount for reliable analysis and predictions.\n     \n     \n3. **Handling Duplicates**:\n   - For the purpose of EDA, we will ignore duplicate entries to understand how many people provided the same responses. This can give us insights into common patterns and trends in the data.\n\n---\nAfter understanding the data, the following section focuses on data preparation and modeling steps.\n"

Sleep disturbances, concentration difficulties, fluctuating interest in activities, and chronic fatigue are common. Anxiety, panic attacks, social withdrawal, and dissociation vary with mood states."

        "**After conducting a thorough analysis of the `User_ID` column within our survey dataset, we arrived at the following conclusions:**\n\n1. Correlation Analysis\n\nUpon converting all categorical data to numerical values and calculating the correlation matrix, it was observed that the correlation between the `User_ID` column and other features is significantly low. This indicates that `User_ID` does not have a strong linear relationship with any other single feature in the dataset.\n\n2. Interpretation of `User_ID`\n\nAlthough the exact purpose of the `User_ID` column remains unclear from the correlation analysis alone, we cannot arbitrarily decide what `User_ID` represents. The limited number of unique values (1-9) suggests that `User_ID` might be representing a specific grouping or classification within the survey data, but further domain knowledge or metadata would be required to confirm its exact role.\n\n---\n3. Decision on Retaining `User_ID`\n\nGiven the potential significance of the `User_ID` column, we have decided not to drop it from our dataset. Despite its low correlation with other features, `User_ID` might still provide valuable information that could help our model understand underlying patterns or groupings in the data. Retaining `User_ID` ensures that we do not inadvertently discard any useful information that could contribute to our analysis or modeling efforts.\n\n\n---\nAfter understanding the data, the following section focuses on data preparation and modeling steps.\n"
