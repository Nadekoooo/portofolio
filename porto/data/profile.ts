  longBio: `I am a Computer Science undergraduate at the University of Indonesia with deep expertise in end-to-end Machine Learning and Deep Learning development. My technical journey is defined by a relentless pursuit of solving complex problems through data—whether it's engineering micro-accurate ground truth datasets for egocentric video analysis at ETH Zürich or deploying intelligent RAG-based AI Agents for stock market automation at RTI Infokom.

My research focuses on Computer Vision and NLP, specifically in areas like domain adaptation, continual learning (STEA Framework), and automatic citation prediction. I have actively contributed to top-tier AI conferences (CVPR, ICCV) and consistently test my skills in national competitions, securing top podium finishes in GEMASTIK, Satria Data, and various Hackathons.

Beyond research and development, I am deeply committed to education. As a Teaching Assistant for Intro to AI, Data Science, and Programming Foundations, I have mentored over 600 students, helping them master the building blocks of modern computing. I believe in the power of community and knowledge sharing, which drives my involvement as an AI Consultant for COMPFEST and as a Brand Ambassador for PANDI.`,
